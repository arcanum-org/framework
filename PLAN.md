# Framework Completion Plan

This checklist tracks remaining work to complete all packages in the Arcanum framework. Each item is a small unit of work that includes 100% test coverage.

---

## Completed Work

All core packages, the Rune CLI transport, and the Shodo/Hyper rendering refactor are complete. 1402 tests, PHPStan clean.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Starter project (click to expand)</summary>

- Full CQRS pipeline: Router → Hydrator → Conveyor → Renderer
- Example Query (Health), Command (Contact/Submit), Page (Index)
- HTTP + CLI entry points with shared bootstrapper architecture
- Config: app.php, routes.php, formats.php, middleware.php, cache.php, cors.php, log.php
- CORS middleware example

</details>

<details>
<summary>Shodo/Hyper rendering refactor (click to expand)</summary>

Shodo was decoupled from Hyper — formatters produce strings, response renderers build HTTP responses:

- **Phase 1** — Formatter interface, extracted JsonFormatter/CsvFormatter/HtmlFormatter/PlainTextFormatter, renamed CliRenderer→KeyValueFormatter, TableRenderer→TableFormatter, deleted CliJsonRenderer, updated CliFormatRegistry+RuneKernel.
- **Phase 2** — ResponseRenderer abstract class, JsonResponseRenderer/CsvResponseRenderer/HtmlResponseRenderer/PlainTextResponseRenderer, EmptyResponseRenderer, JsonExceptionResponseRenderer in Hyper.
- **Phase 3+4** — Deleted old Shodo renderers+Renderer interface, moved FormatRegistry to Hyper, decoupled UnsupportedFormat from HttpException, rewired Bootstrap\Routing, updated starter app and integration tests.
- **Phase 5** — Verified all pipelines (HTTP+CLI), zero dead code, updated Shodo README.

All package READMEs written/updated: Cabinet, Codex, Echo, Gather, Parchment, Flow (Pipeline, Continuum, Conveyor, River), Shodo, Atlas, Hyper, Glitch, Quill, Ignition, Toolkit, Rune. Root README updated with all packages.

## Remaining Work

### Deferred — Command Response Enhancements

Blocked on persistence layer:

- **`Location` header for 201 responses** — requires reverse routing (URL generation from a class/identifier) and a persistence layer (handlers need to create things and get IDs back). In CQRS, commands and queries live at different paths, so there's no canonical resource URL to point to like in REST/CRUD. A `Locatable` interface would force devs to hardcode URLs, which is brittle. Revisit after: persistence layer, reverse routing, and a convention linking Commands to their corresponding Queries.
- **Integration tests for 202/201 in Kernel** — straightforward once the Location header is settled, but low value without it.

---

## Future Work

### Persistence Layer

A database/filesystem/SQLite persistence layer to make Arcanum a viable full-stack framework. CLI commands like migrations, schema management, and seed scripts can now use Rune. Design should embrace CQRS: repositories for the write side (aggregates), query builder for the read side (projections). Not a full ORM — lightweight entity mapping, not Doctrine-level magic.

Key areas: connection management (PDO, multi-driver), repository pattern, query builder, migrations, schema management, entity hydration. The `Location` header for 201 responses (deferred above) depends on this + reverse routing.

---

## Closed Questions

Decided — preserved for context:

- ~~**Bootstrap lifecycle hooks**~~ — **Won't do.** The app controls the Kernel subclass and can add, remove, or reorder bootstrappers directly.
- ~~**Handler auto-discovery**~~ — **Won't do for runtime.** Codex resolves handlers on demand via reflection. Boot-time validation is the `validate:handlers` CLI command.
- ~~**Opt-in command response bodies**~~ — **Won't do.** Commands shouldn't respond with data. The Location header (once persistence + reverse routing exist) gives clients a way to fetch the created resource via a proper Query.
- ~~**CLI command prefixes**~~ — `command:` or `query:` prefix for domain dispatch. No prefix = built-in framework command.
- ~~**CLI custom routes vs HTTP custom routes**~~ — Independent configs under `config/routes.php` (`http` and `cli` keys).
- ~~**Renderer return type**~~ — Resolved by Shodo/Hyper refactor. Formatters return strings, ResponseRenderers return ResponseInterface.
- ~~**Shodo renderers are HTTP-specific**~~ — Resolved by Shodo/Hyper refactor.
- ~~**CLI debug mode not respecting config**~~ — Not a bug. Starter app's `.env` sets `APP_DEBUG=true`.
