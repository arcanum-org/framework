# Security Policy
Since Arcanum is under heavy development, we have yet to release a stable version. For now, all security related issues will be supported and maintained on the main branch.

## Reporting Security Issues
While it's unlikely to affect production users at this time, please refrain from disclosing security-related issues publicly. Send an email with these problems to young.steveo@gmail.com.
