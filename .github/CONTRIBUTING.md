# Contribution Guidelines
Welcome! Thank you for your interest in contributing to Arcanum.

## Bug Reports
Found a bug? Great–you're helping us make Arcanum better! When you file a bug report, make sure to give it a clear and informative title, and describe the issue as clearly as possible. Don't forget to add any relevant details that might help us understand what's going wrong. A code sample that shows the issue would be fantastic too–it makes the bug easier to replicate and speeds up the hunt for a fix!

When you file a bug report, you're not just helping us, you're also helping others who might be encountering the same issue. Your report could be the first step towards a solution! But, while we appreciate every bug report we receive, we might not be able to jump straight on it, so patience is key.

## Getting Support & Proposing New Features
Arcanum's GitHub issues aren't the right place for getting help or support. But don't worry, we've got you covered! Head over to the [Arcanum discussion board](https://github.com/arcanum-org/framework/discussions) for any questions you have or support you need. It's also the go-to spot for suggesting new features or discussing tweaks to improve Arcanum's existing functionalities.

We would absolutely love to hear about your innovative ideas for new features! If you have a proposal, we'd kindly ask you to be ready to contribute towards some of the coding needed to make it happen.

## Coding Style
Arcanum follows the [PSR-12 Extended Coding Style](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/), with a few more optional rules as defined in the [phpcs-ruleset.xml](https://github.com/arcanum-org/framework/blob/main/contrib/phpcs-ruleset.xml) file.

## Where To Send Pull Requests
Arcanum is currently under heavy development. For now, you can just point your pull requests at the `main` branch. Once we have a stable release, we'll update these contribution guidelines with further instructions.

## Handling Security Issues
Stumbled upon a potential security vulnerability in Arcanum? Your quick action is important to us. We'd appreciate it if you could shoot an email to Stephen Young at young.steveo@gmail.com right away. To ensure the Arcanum community's safety, please refrain from creating a public issue or posting a discussion about the vulnerability. This helps us prevent the spread of awareness about the vulnerability before we've had a chance to address it properly.
